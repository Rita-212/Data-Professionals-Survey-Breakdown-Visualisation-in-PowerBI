<B> Data Professionals Survey Breakdown Dashboard </B><br>

Using Power BI and Power Query Editor, I visualized the breakdown of the data professional survey to practice and refine my skills in Power BI and data analytics. By creating interactive and visually engaging dashboards, I ensured that data insights were presented in a clear and impactful manner. Advanced data transformation techniques were applied to clean and prepare the dataset, enabling accurate and comprehensive analysis. Dynamic filters and slicers were integrated into the dashboards, offering users the ability to explore the data from multiple perspectives with ease. Key metrics and trends were emphasized through thoughtfully designed visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables. This project demonstrated my proficiency in Power BI for data visualization and analysis, while also helping me enhance my expertise in data-driven decision-making processes.
